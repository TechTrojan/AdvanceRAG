We believe Windows competes \neffectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware \nand software applications, including those that enable productivity. \nDevices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality \nindustrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. Many of these manufacturers are also current or potential partners \nand customers, including our Windows OEMs.. marketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors.

We work with you on making architectural trade-oﬀs as your designs evolve. \nAs you deploy these systems into live environments, we learn how well these systems perform and \nthe consequences of those trade-oﬀs.\nBased on what we have learned, we have created the AWS Well-Architected Framework, which \nprovides a consistent set of best practices for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, \nand provides a set of questions you can use to evaluate how well an architecture is aligned to AWS \nbest practices.\nThe AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on six pillars — operational excellence, security, \nreliability, performance eﬃciency, cost optimization, and sustainability.\nTable 1.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework documents a set of foundational questions that help you to \nunderstand if a speciﬁc architecture aligns well with cloud best practices. The framework provides \na consistent approach to evaluating systems against the qualities you expect from modern cloud-\nbased systems, and the remediation that would be required to achieve those qualities. As AWS \ncontinues to evolve, and we continue to learn more from working with our customers, we will \ncontinue to reﬁne the deﬁnition of well-architected.\nThis framework is intended for those in technology roles, such as chief technology oﬃcers \n(CTOs), architects, developers, and operations team members. It describes AWS best practices and \nstrategies to use when designing and operating a cloud workload, and provides links to further \nimplementation details and architectural patterns.

AWS Well-Architected Framework\nFramework\nThe pillars of the framework\nCreating a software system is a lot like constructing a building. If the foundation is not solid, \nstructural problems can undermine the integrity and function of the building. When architecting \ntechnology solutions, if you neglect the six pillars of operational excellence, security, reliability, \nperformance eﬃciency, cost optimization, and sustainability, it can become challenging to build a \nsystem that delivers on your expectations and requirements. Incorporating these pillars into your \narchitecture will help you produce stable and eﬃcient systems. This will allow you to focus on the \nother aspects of design, such as functional requirements.\nPillars\n• Operational excellence\n• Security\n• Reliability\n• Performance eﬃciency\n• Cost optimization\n• Sustainability\nOperational excellence\nOperational excellence (OE) is a commitment to build software correctly while consistently. AWS Well-Architected Framework\nFramework\nTo achieve reliability, you must start with the foundations — an environment where Service Quotas \nand network topology accommodate the workload. The workload architecture of the distributed \nsystem must be designed to prevent and mitigate failures. The workload must handle changes in \ndemand or requirements, and it must be designed to detect failure and automatically heal itself.\nBest practices\nTopics\n• Foundations\n• Workload architecture\n• Change management\n• Failure management\nFoundations\nFoundational requirements are those whose scope extends beyond a single workload or project. \nBefore architecting any system, foundational requirements that inﬂuence reliability should be in \nplace. For example, you must have suﬃcient network bandwidth to your data center.\nWith AWS, most of these foundational requirements are already incorporated or can be addressed",
